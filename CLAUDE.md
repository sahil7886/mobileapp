# CoreApp

Kotlin Multiplatform / Compose Multiplatform app targeting iOS.

## Overview

- App supports modern Pebble watches over BLE, exposing features like notifications, health data, watchfaces, and more.
- This fork is local-first: it has no Firebase-backed account, Locker, or Ring product.

## Platform Rules

- **Target iOS.** Write shared code in `commonMain` where it benefits the retained iOS product; platform-specific work belongs in `iosMain` or the Swift shell.
- Do not alter the Pebble Bluetooth/protocol path or the public app/watchface catalog without an explicit request.

## Repository layout

- `:composeApp` — shared Compose UI / Cocoapods / Koin DI, and the iOS entry point. KMP library.
- `:libpebble3` — KMP library for talking to Pebble/Core watches (BLE, protocol, services, endpoint managers). Mirrored from a standalone repo.
- `:pebble` — Pebble-related shared code used by the app.
- `:util` — shared utilities (logging, IO, local identity, etc.).
- `:mcp`, `:index-ai`, `:libindex` — compatibility/data modules used by the retained build.
- `:cactus`, `:resampler`, `:krisp-stubs` — audio/ML support modules.
- `:blobannotations`, `:blobdbgen` — KSP annotations + code generator for Pebble blobdb.

iOS app project: `iosApp/iosApp.xcworkspace` (always open the `.xcworkspace`, not `.xcodeproj`).

## General editing info

- Source layout per active module follows standard KMP: `src/commonMain/kotlin`, `src/iosMain/kotlin`, and tests. Android source directories are inactive historical reference.
- Compose resources are generated under the package `coreapp.composeapp.generated.resources`.
- `versionName` requires a git tag (e.g. `git tag 1.0.0`) or falls back to `"unknown"`.
- DI is Koin (`koin-core`, `koin-compose`, `koin-compose-viewmodel`); navigation uses `androidx.navigation.compose`; logging uses Kermit; HTTP uses Ktor/Darwin on iOS.
- Some dependencies are internally developed and published. You can still ask for the source code of these dependencies to be included in the session if you need more context but don't try looking for it in the filesystem.

## Guidance

- Project follows DRY principles; attempt to use shared code and split out to platform-specific when required or more performant. The `util` module can be used for potentially reusable generic utilities, even if it isn't reused now.
- Changes should reuse existing code where possible and loosely follow clean coding principles, this is a big project which requires production-level maintainable code and good separation of concerns to stay manageable.
- Write tests for new logic, and consider test coverage when modifying existing code. Try to stick to unit tests where possible.
- Never use kotlin class `init()` blocks. These are invoked on class creation (happens during DI graph init and could block main thread/happen at an unexpected time). Use an explicit initialization method if needed, called from somewhere sensible.
- We don't need every method documents with comments describing exactly what it does in detail. Just comment if something is interesting/not obvious.
- More on comments: you write comments which are far too verbose - please don't. Don't write a comment against code unless it's really required for someone to understand the code. Specifically banned:
  - "X, not Y" comments naming a rejected alternative — X is already in the code; nobody cares about Y.
  - Ticket/issue references (MOB-1234) in comments — the commit message carries that.
  - Comments defending why the change is correct — that's for the reviewer, and it's noise after merge.
  - Default to no comment on a fix. If the code has a genuine landmine someone would reintroduce later, one line stating the constraint itself; the full story goes in the commit message.

## Code Guidelines

### 1. Minimal fixes only — no scope creep

Make the smallest change that fixes the problem. Do not bundle extra "improvements," retry logic, or defensive code alongside a root-cause fix. If a bug is a one-line fix, the PR should be a one-line fix. Reviewers will extract the minimal fix and discard the rest.

- **Bad:** Fixing a stale token bug (`authStateChanged` → `idTokenChanged`) + adding retry loops + adding token refresh in UI layer. Reviewer merged only the one-line fix.
- **Bad:** Fixing a dispatcher issue (`Dispatchers.IO` → `Dispatchers.Default`) + restructuring file writes to be async fire-and-forget. Reviewer took only the dispatcher change.

### 2. Use existing abstractions at the correct scope — don't reinvent

Before writing new code, search for existing services, injectables, and utilities that already do what you need. This codebase uses dependency injection extensively. If something feels like it should exist, it probably does. When adding state, put it at the correct DI scope — per-watch state belongs in per-watch services, not in singletons.

- **Bad:** Manually querying DAOs and iterating trace sessions to find the right one to append to. The injectable `RingTraceSession` already tracks the current session.
- **Bad:** Writing temp files for audio playback. In-memory `MediaDataSource` (Android) avoids temp file management entirely.
- **Bad:** Putting per-watch timezone tracking state in `LibPebble3` (singleton). It belongs in `SystemService` (per-watch). Reviewer moved it.

### 3. Understand root causes before fixing

Do not apply brute-force workarounds to symptoms. Understand why something is happening before changing it.

- **Bad:** Removing `LookaheadScope` to "fix" an animation. The actual bug was a Compose recomposition where bounds changed from 0 to full width on first compose. The "fix" just made the UI blink jarringly instead.
- **Bad:** Setting `disableNextTransitionAnimation = true` by default. This disabled ALL page transitions, not just the problematic one.

### 4. Distinguish transient vs. deterministic failures

Do not mark deterministic failures as recoverable/retryable. If a transcription model can't handle audio, retrying won't change the outcome — it just holds up the processing queue for other recordings.

- **Rule:** Network errors = transient (retry). Model/processing errors = deterministic (fail permanently).

### 5. Never blur state boundaries for marginal performance

If the system defines clear states (transferring → complete), do not introduce async operations that make a recording appear "complete" while files are still being written. "It'll be fast enough" is not a correctness argument.

- **Bad:** Fire-and-forget async file write after marking recording complete. A user could see a transcription-failed file with no playable audio, or a bug report could be missing its audio attachment.

### 6. Use the existing permission-nag UI — don't add manual permission requests

Most code runs in background services where requesting permissions isn't possible. The app already has a UI that nags users about missing permissions. Don't add manual `requestPermission()` calls in feature code — rely on the existing permission flow and handle the denied case gracefully.

### 7. Keep PRs single-purpose

Each PR should address one concern. Do not bundle animation fixes + trace timeline + retry UI + error handling changes into one PR. Multi-concern PRs are harder to review and get closed as "rewritten" when any part is wrong.

### 8. Include tests for new logic

Non-trivial new logic (parsers, encoders, state machines) must have unit tests. When Alice rewrote the M4A feature, she included 324 lines of tests for the M4A parser. The original PR had zero.

### 9. Prefer simple architectures over clever ones

When adding a new format/encoding, prefer keeping the local storage format unchanged and converting at the boundary (upload/download). Don't introduce MIME-type dispatch, dual playback paths, or multi-step file replacement schemes when you can encode on upload and decode on download.

## Building/installing

### Basics

- Gradle wrapper at the root: `./gradlew`.
- JDK 17 required. JVM target is 17 across modules.
- Version catalog: `gradle/libs.versions.toml`.
- iOS: `./gradlew podInstall`, then build from Xcode against `iosApp/iosApp.xcworkspace`.
- The iOS framework is named `ComposeApp` and is wired up via the Kotlin Cocoapods plugin in `composeApp/build.gradle.kts`.

### iOS

- **iOS simulator linker fix:** `composeApp/build.gradle.kts` hardcodes the Swift compatibility lib search path to `.../usr/lib/swift/iphoneos`, which breaks simulator links (`ld: building for 'iOS-simulator', but linking in object file ... libswiftCompatibility*.a ... built for 'iOS'`). For local simulator builds, change that path's `iphoneos` to `$osName` (the `osName` val already computed just above resolves to `iphonesimulator` for the sim targets). Device builds are unaffected either way.
- **Iterating on iOS — swap the framework binary, don't rebuild Pebble.app.** A full xcodebuild from scratch takes ~30 min. After the first successful build of `Pebble.app`, every subsequent Kotlin source change only needs:
    1. `./gradlew :composeApp:linkPodDebugFrameworkIosSimulatorArm64` — relinks the K/N framework into `composeApp/build/bin/iosSimulatorArm64/podDebugFramework/ComposeApp.framework/`
    2. `cp` the new `ComposeApp` binary over `iosApp/build/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/Pebble.app/Frameworks/ComposeApp.framework/ComposeApp`
    3. `codesign --force --sign - --preserve-metadata=identifier,entitlements,flags --timestamp=none` on the framework, then on `Pebble.app` itself
    4. `xcrun simctl uninstall` + `install` + `launch` — no xcodebuild needed
       Only run a full `xcodebuild` again when you change Swift code, Info.plist, resources, or pod dependencies.
